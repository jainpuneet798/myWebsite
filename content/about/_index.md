Puneet is an engineer/artist working at the intersection of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), Critical Design, and Disability Studies. He is currently pursuing his PhD at Concordia University, Montreal, Canada under the supervision of Artist/Researcher Dr. Christopher Salter, Anthropologist Dr. David Howes, and Artist/Researcher Dr. Alice Jarry. 

Puneet's work could be seen as an investigation in researching alternate forms of interventions between the human and the non-human (a machine, an algorithm, a plant, or sometimes even a slime mould) in a digital space. He follows both research based and an artistic approach for the creation of interfaces to open a critical dialogue between the human and non-human within the digital - questioning how sensory perceptions are morphed, enhanced, and augmented in such a technological manifold. 

He did his masters (by research) in Computation and Data Sciences from Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, India (2014-2016). His research thesis was in the area of Numerical Linear Algebra where he investigated error estimators for iterative algorithms like Bi-Conjugate Gradient to speed up the calculations and improve accuracy in the error estimations. He also worked as a Data Scientist at SAP Labs from 2016-2018 engaging with customers in automotive industries. After working in Industry he worked as a Research Fellow in IISc at the Interaction Design Lab working in the area of Human Computer Interaction. His latest work at the Lab is an adaptive eye-gaze controlled virtual keyboard for people with speech and motor impairment in collaboration with Microsoft Research, India. 

Puneet's work has been showcased both in India (from where his roots emerge) and internationally at venues such Ars Electronica (Linz, Austria), ISEA (Barcelona, Spain), Electronic Literature Organization (Florida, USA), KunstFest (Weimar, Germany) etc.
