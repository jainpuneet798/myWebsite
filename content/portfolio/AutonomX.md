AutonomX is an open source desktop application that allows multimedia artists and students to easily and quickly experiment with life-like processes via a graphical interface to generate dynamic, emergent and self-organizing patterns and output these patterns via OSC and MIDI to control light, sound, video, or even robots in real time, unlike systems that are fixed such as timelines and cue systems.

AutonomX is a project incubated at xModal Lab at Milieux Institute for Arts, Culture, and Technology, Concordia, University, Canada. labXmodal is a studio-lab founded by Chris Salter dedicated to the research, development, and creation of performative environments. I am working as a developer and as an artificial intelligence researcher on the project. The exisiting implemented generators on the project are Spiking Neural Networks, Wolfram Cellular Automata, and Conway's Game of Life. 

AutonomX was recently presented in a workshop at ISEA, 2022 in Barcelona, Spain. Moreover, a research paper was also published at International Symposium of Electronic Arts (ISEA), 2022 that can be accessed through the following link: https://isea2022.isea-international.org/event/full-papers-autonomx-real-time-creation-composition-with-complex-systems/
