	"If you touch a single banana with your two hands, you feel one banana, not two. 
	Thus, the images of the two eyes must be “fused” somewhere in the brain to give rise to a unitary item of perception, or percept. But we can ask the questions, What if the eyes look at completely dissimilar things? Would we perceive a blend?" 
	- VILAYANUR S. RAMACHANDRAN and DIANE ROGERS-RAMACHANDRAN 
	(When the Two Eyes Clash, 2007).

This installation by NOTAAT (a collective by Puneet Jain and Kaldi Moss) exhibited as a part of the series 'Future Foundations' at Walkin Studios, Bangalore, India is an attempt to create a dialogue between people and their visual perception. 

Senses, language, and perception. 

Audience in space witness their virtual bodies projected onto an irregular wall which (captured from the back as they face the projection surface) over time explodes into different surfaces covering all the sides of the projection surface and finally distorts to a blackhole over time, evaporating into a text saying - "Hello".

Dancing between morphing texts and virtual projections of bodies in real space. The illusion of your own body captured in a cuboid that converts into a torus which further takes shape of a ring remotely manifests NOTAAT's liking of the painting "Not to be Reproduced" by Belgian painter and artist Rene Magritte.
