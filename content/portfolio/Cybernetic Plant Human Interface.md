This project explores a proof of concept to open up a dialogue between
a human and a non-human (a Mimosa Plant) in a digital space
where they co-exist together, share the digital space, and compete
for their respective goals to interact with each other resulting in a
cybernetic performance over time.

## Introduction

The intake of digital information till date is heavily based on rectangular
computer screens and demand an acute visual focus (which is
also overwhelmingly visual from a cultural/social sensory point of
view) of the observer. The observer (often termed as the user) reads
the visual content (text, images) from the screen that most oftenly
remains static and exists independent of the carbon
footprint produced by the user, exploitation of the human labor for
the mining processes to build hardware for these machines, and
the impact of human activities on the world outside the human
life thus creating biased sensory perceptions about the world - the
world where humans co-exist with other living and non-living being.

Hence, the goal of this project is to build a multi-sensory digital
interface (a text writing platform) as a proof of concept where the
human is coupled with a non-human (a mimosa plant) to interact
in a digital space thus metaphorically depicting the importance of
each other’s presence for existence.
The digital interface for this project is designed to be a text writing
platform where the typography of the text (font size, spacing,
color) dynamically evolves over time based on the respective goals
of the human and the non-human while the interface acts as a
communication channel (See Figure). The non-human chosen for this
project is a touch sensitive mimosa plant whose leaves fold inward
and droop when touched or shaken and re-open a few minutes
later (≈ 10min). The goal of the user is to enter text with a typing
speed (measured in letters per frame) which should not exceed the
threshold limit set by the user themselves. The color of the text and
the background, font size, and the positioning of the letters on the
platform are set as a function of the typing speed and in case the
typing speed exceeds the threshold limit, an external stimulus (set
up as a part of the system) acts on the leaves of the mimosa, making
the leaves fold - effecting their equilibrium state. Hence, in response,
the plant triggers a change in the typography on the screen and a
haptic signal to the user with the help of linear resonant actuators.
This cybernetic performance can be visualized on the platform
in the form of a morphing typography as the human and the non-human
fight for their respective goals while co-existing together.

## Objectives of the Project

* Present a POC for a human and non-human digital interface.
* Provide a methodology to understand sensing mechanism of
both human and the non-human, choice of the sensors and
actuators, and scientific and artistic challenges in the design
process.
* Lay out a ground work for the design of a cybernetic digital
interfaces.
