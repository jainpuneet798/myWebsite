## Ars Electronica Video Description 


## PART 1

Some videos on excavation practices - mining 
Some videos of human labor making computer technologies 
Some videos on prediction; facial recognition, body tracking; people annotating data 


#### After the videos:

"A brief command and a response is the most common form of engagement with a common consumer voice-enabled AI device like Alexa or Siri (fade) But in this fleeting moment of interaction, a vast matrix of capacities is invoked: (fade) interlaced chains of resource extraction, human labor and algorithmic processing across networks of mining, logistics, distribution, prediction and optimization. 
(mic drop) The scale of this system is almost beyond human imagining." - Anatomy of AI, Kate Crawford.

PART 2 

##### Mimsoa Pudica videos + with the camera 

Mimosa Pudica, also known as the touch-me-not plant shows seismonastic movements by reacting to various stimuli in its environment ranging from sunlight and wind to human touch. 
All plants react and response to their environments, however, Mimosa Pudica responds  in a time scale perceivable by the humans.

The amazon bush fires, climatic catastrophies (give more examples) reminds us how we are still stuck in a mere antropocentric view of the world; stuck with our rectangular screens in human-human interactions amplifying the banal non-embodied perspectives thus calling for a mutual intelligible dialogue with the the world -  a world comprising of humans (show text till here) (now show this after 2 sec) and the non-humans.  

We are in state of emergency and urgency to bring into account non-human perspectives to envision, speculate and design new age interaction systems which help us to communicate and collectively decide possible futures. 

PART 3 

"We no longer regard animals as mere machines, but as subjects whose essential activity consists of perceiving and acting. We thus unlock the gates that lead to other realms, for all that a subject perceives becomes his perceptual world and all that he does , his effector world. Perceptual and effector worlds together form a closed unit, the Umwelt"


'Umwelten' is an invitation to a plant, a human, and a machine learning algorithm to meet in the same physical space to achieve a mutual intelligibility to negotiate and reformulate policies for the present and upcoming emergencies. (fade next line)  As Lucy Suchman would also say - a mutual intellgibility needed to expose the latent inextricably intertwined networks that humans share with the others - the non-humans.

Umwelten provides the same physical space to the human and the non-humans to entangle, collide, deform, and morph umwelts to intitate an exchange of messages. Such messages are seen in the form of dynamically evolving typography (changing color, font size, spacing between the letters) effected by the typing speed of a human as they type on the screen.

Meanwhile, a camera pointing to the plant clicks images of the plant frame by frame and send it to a machine learning algorithm, classifying the plant into two categories - 'Mimosa Open' and 'Mimosa closed' with respective classification probabilities. The umwelt of the Mimosa overlaps with the umwelt of the camera as the light, angle of the camera, resolution and computational time of the algorithm affects the predictive probabilites of the algorithm. 

A cybernetic informational exchange is visualized in the form of a dymanically evolving typography among the human, the algorithm and the plant, as the output of the algorithm (in the form of probabilities) also influence the typography of the text disrupting the input/output of the human. The cluttered typography on the screen is also new language emerging with a grammar common to the plant, the human and the learning algorithm.

This urges us to question whether this negotiation about the futures through this language between the three entities on the screen is also a confusion - a confusion emerging from the different spatial and temporal perceptions of the three entities?

We wonder whether this confusion is not only inevitable but necessary for going beyond the anthropocentrism and to pull ourselves back to the ontological question of being V/s becoming.

PART 4 


#### a video of many such systems overlapping with one another

What futures are queued and cancelled when a network of multitudes of human, plant, machine interfaces interface globally?
How does a new grammar of cybernetic exchange of emotions, affect and sensory perceptions look like?

#### A shot of the entire set up with the below text


"Environments are not passive wrappings, but are, rather, active processes which are invisible. The groundrules, pervasive structures, and over-all patterns of environments elude easy perception. Anti- environments, or countersituations made by artists, provide means of direct attention and enable us to see and understand more clearly." - Marshall Mc Luhan (Medium is the Message)

The umwelt of any animal that we wish to investigate is only a section carved
out of the environmnt which we spread around it-and this environment is
nothing but our human world. The first task of Umwelt research is to identify each animals perceptual cues among all the stimuli in its environment and to build up the animals specific world with them.

We no longer regard animals as mere machines, but as subjects whose essential activity consists of perceiving and acting. We thus unlock the gates that lead to other realms, for all that a subject perceives becomes his perceptual world and all that he does , his effector world. Perceptual and effector worlds together form a closed unit, the Umwelt.
