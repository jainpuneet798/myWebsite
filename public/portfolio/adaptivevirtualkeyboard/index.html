         <h1>Adaptive Gaze Controlled Virtual Keyboard for people with sensorimotor disabilities</h1>
         <p>The common input modalities used by people for interacting with a computer are limited to a mouse or a physical keyboard - mostly operated using hands.</p>
<p>However, these devices seem futile when the users are motor-impaired or have constrained body movements. The following project is a virtual keyboard that is operated through eye-gaze rather than hands. The keyboard has a modified QWERTY layout and is integrated with a customized machine learning algorithm to dynamically adapt dwell time of the keys.  The &lsquo;dwell time&rsquo; is the threshold time for which one has to fixate his eyes (or gaze) on a key/button on the screen to perform a mouse click through gaze.</p>
<p><img src="/img/Projects/VirtualKeyboard/kritika.jpg" alt="This is me"></p>
<p>The image above depicts one of the initial prototypes that we built for gaze-typing. Kritika (able-bodied) who is a PhD student at IISc (in the image) is using the application to type their name. We use a Tobii Eye tracker to track the eye movements on a 17-inch screen. The keyboard is also integrated with visual (yellow boundary for the button on which gaze is fixated) and auditory (pronouncing the character typed) feedback.</p>
<p><img src="/img/Projects/VirtualKeyboard/virtualKeyboard.png" alt=""></p>
<p>While the keyboard can be used by the able-bodied persons too, one of its prime importance comes into picture when they are operated by children (motor impaired) at Vidya Sagar (formerly known as the Spastic Society of India), Chennai, India.</p>
<p><img src="/img/Projects/VirtualKeyboard/img4.jpg" alt="This"></p>
<h2 id="objectives--of-the-project">Objectives  of the project</h2>
<p>*To make a gaze-controlled interface for people with motor impairment.​</p>
<p>*To reiterate the design of the interface after multiple trials with the users. This includes the placement of the keys and spaces between them, and inclusion  and integration of multiple modalities like sound in the product.</p>
<p>*To build a customized machine learning algorithm to dynamically update the dwell time of the keys by learning the user’s usage pattern.</p>
<h2 id="results-of-the-project">Results of the project</h2>
<ol>
<li>A modified two-level gaze-controlled virtual keyboard for people with motor impairment that is currently in use at Vidya Sagar, Chennai (See the figures below). In order to give ample gaze time to find the key, the keyboard is designed to be a two-level keyboard. In other words, selecting YUIOP key opens up individual keys Y,U,I,O and P for the final selection. The design was tested with the students at the school and was approved by them and their trainers as the final prototype.</li>
</ol>

<ol start="2">
<li>The keyboard is integrated with a Markovian based approach to dynamically adapt dwell time of the keys to increase typing speed while maintaining accuracy. The equation below is used to calculate the dwell time of a key on the keyboard based on the previous typing data from the user. Here Dmin refers to the minimum dwell time of any key (set to 300ms to avoid Midas Touch). Pr denotes the probability of selecting a key i after the selection of a key j. Higher is the probability of selection, lower is the dwell time of the key to increase speed while maintaining accuracy.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="/img/Projects/VirtualKeyboard/Equation1b.PNG" alt=""></p>
<ol start="3">
<li>The keyboard is currently installed at Vidya Sagar, Chennai for enhancing digital literacy among the students. Moreover the work is accepted at the Journal of Technology and Disabilities 2021.</li>
